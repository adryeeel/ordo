## Feature Interactions

### Complete Work Lifecycle

1. **Work is created and defined** → enters the work initiation and management experience
2. **A team is assigned** → connects the work to the responsible people and permissions
3. **Progress is updated** → reflects execution activity and status changes
4. **Work is submitted for review** → moves into the approval phase
5. **A review decision is made** → determines whether the work is completed or returned for revision
6. **Billing and reporting outputs are generated** → follow the approved completion state
7. **Important actions are recorded** → maintain accountability and traceability

Together, these areas describe a coherent product journey from initiation to billing.
