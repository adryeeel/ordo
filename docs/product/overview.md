# Overview

## Purpose

Ordo is intended to be a platform that helps service-based businesses manage structured work execution, team assignment, and billing in a more consistent way.

This document describes the product direction and intended user experience rather than a fully implemented system. The current repository shows an early frontend foundation, so the product description should be treated as a working product vision that will evolve as the product matures.

## The Problem

Service-based companies manage client work using fragmented tools: email, spreadsheets, chat apps, and manual tracking systems.

This fragmentation creates several critical issues:

- **Lack of structured tracking** — Client work lacks a central system of record
- **Unclear ownership** — Tasks and responsibilities are ambiguous
- **Poor visibility** — Work progress is difficult to track and report
- **Manual coordination** — Managers and employees manually coordinate across tools
- **Delayed billing** — Invoice generation requires manual compilation after work completion
- **Missing audit trail** — No immutable record of work execution and approvals

## The Solution

Ordo provides a **structured system** for managing client work from request to completion and billing.

The system enforces a defined lifecycle for work execution, ensuring:

- **Clear assignment** — Responsibilities are explicitly assigned
- **Controlled flow** — Work progresses through defined states
- **Managerial validation** — Completed work requires approval before billing
- **Automated billing** — Invoices and reports generate automatically upon completion
- **Full auditability** — All key actions are immutable and traceable

### Key Insight

Ordo uses a **structured workflow pattern** where work is explicitly assigned, executed with visibility, submitted for validation, and approved by management before billing. This creates a clear, auditable path from work initiation to completion and invoicing.

## Core Value Proposition

| Challenge           | Ordo Solution                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Fragmented tools    | Single system of record for all work               |
| Unclear ownership   | Explicit team assignments with permissions         |
| Poor visibility     | Real-time status and progress tracking             |
| Manual coordination | Structured workflows eliminate ad-hoc coordination |
| Invoice delays      | Automated invoice generation on completion         |
| No audit trail      | Immutable logs of all key actions                  |

## Product Implications

The product direction suggests a clear separation between the core phases of work:

- work intake and planning
- team assignment and execution
- review and approval
- completion and billing

A strong product experience should make these phases visible, understandable, and accountable for the people involved.
